    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <h2>Hello, CS 3338</h2>
    <p>This is to be the first project of the class. The first Lab assigned.</p>
    <h3>My software idea</h3>
    <p>My software idea is to create a Polling application where students can create polls and display real-time graphs.
        Or maybe a some sort of Game Review Hub where users can submit reviews and ratings for their favorite games.
